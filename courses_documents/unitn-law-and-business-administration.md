# University of Trento, Law and Buisness Administration

## Course Overview

In our society, the system of norms constantly interacts with the lives of businesses and individuals. The ability to understand and master the knowledge and tools of business administration in relation to the legal system represents a strength for modern professionals, ready to operate in companies and public administrations.

The degree in Business Administration and Law integrates with the master's program to train professionals (such as accountants), defining a pathway that is highly professionalizing from the start. Alternatively, it opens the doors to many subsequent specializations related to the complex world of public administrations and enterprises.

The degree program is designed for ambitious students who, upon enrollment, wish to embark on a course of study that could conclude with a master's degree in Business Economics and Legislation, with the aim of acquiring a high level of specialization and professional competencies (for the accounting profession).

### Educational Objectives

The degree in Business Administration and Law (L18 degree class) aims to:

- Provide an integrated set of knowledge related to economics, business administration, and law;
- Develop application skills and communication techniques, aimed at managing economic organizations;
- Integrate business and economic training with legal knowledge in areas directly relevant to companies and entities (both private and public).

The degree program includes a mandatory internship:

- For those who choose the orientation towards private professions, mainly within professional firms or auditing companies;
- For those who choose the orientation towards public professions, it can take place in public entities and companies.

Additionally, workshops are planned, organized in collaboration with professionals, during which theoretical knowledge is applied in real contexts.

### The Pathway for Accountants

The training cycle for the accounting profession is a five-year program designed and managed with professional bodies, ensuring the best conditions to face the qualification exam and pursue the profession of an accountant. It consists of a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Law (three years), a master's degree in Business Economics and Legislation (LM77), an internship at professional firms, a post-graduation internship, and placement.

In this way, students selected for the "private professions" pathway in Business Administration and Law find a curriculum that strongly integrates with professional work, paving the way for obtaining the specific master's degree in Business Economics and Legislation, ensuring the best conditions for access to the accounting profession.

### Career and Study Opportunities

Graduates in Business Administration and Law can:

- Access the qualification to practice as an accountant at level B of the professional register, or in any case, complete the preparatory training for finishing the specific master's degree aimed at registration at level A of the same register. This completes the five-year cycle for training accountants (COM). A specific agreement, published on the Regulations and Rules page, governs the professional internship and exemption from the first written exam required by the state exam.
- Be employed in businesses and non-profit organizations as officials with responsibilities in economic-financial, accounting, and administrative roles;
- Be employed in public administrations as officials, with broad tasks in management and administration.

Graduates can also decide to continue their education in master's degrees in economics and business-related fields or other related areas.
