**Language of Instruction:** Italian  
**Access Mode:** Programmed, with the requirement of passing an admission test  
**Location:** Department of Sociology and Social Research, via Verdi 26, 38122 Trento  

The International Studies program primarily focuses on social and political phenomena in the European and international contexts. The approach is multidisciplinary, covering knowledge in political science, law, international history, sociology, and European and international economics.

### **Educational Objectives**

The Bachelor's Degree in International Studies, within the "Political Science and International Relations" class, aims to provide students with foundational knowledge, theoretical and methodological tools, and advanced linguistic skills to understand the characteristics and dynamics of international phenomena. The main goal is to understand the complexity of topics such as globalization, international relations, development cooperation, internationalization, and European integration.

- **First Year:**  
  Students will learn the "foundations" of major social sciences and statistics. In sociology, they will be introduced to concepts and notions necessary for analyzing society and social change. In contemporary history, they will study significant events of the 20th century and their key interpretations. In political science, students will learn the language and conceptualizations specific to the discipline, focusing on the democratic process and democratization. In political economy, attention will be given to the main macroeconomic theories. Public law will introduce elements of European public law, as a combination of state and supranational law. In statistics, the basics of data analysis will be taught. Special emphasis is placed on English language skills.

- **Second Year:**  
  The second year presents essential tools for empirical research in social sciences and knowledge of international law. It also covers comparative political systems, their behavior, and international relations. From a historical perspective, students will learn about the development of the modern state from medieval origins to the consolidation of the modern era, concluding with a brief discussion on the crisis of the contemporary state. As in the first year, a specialized English course will complement linguistic training. Some courses will be specific to two educational tracks. In the "Politics and International Organizations" track, students will study international organizations, while in the "Cooperation and Development" track, the focus will be on topics from international development sociology.

- **Third Year:**  
  The third year offers more specific courses, dedicated to key research topics in European and international studies, social inequalities, social movements, European civil society, citizenship and European democracy, conflict management, and more. An international political economy course will complete the multidisciplinary training. By the end of the third year, students must demonstrate knowledge of a second foreign language. Additionally, seminars on contemporary economic, political, and social system transformations will be offered. To enhance coherence in the curriculum, students are encouraged to choose two elective exams from a selection of key subjects.

### **Career Profiles**

The development of the European Union and changes in the international system open up new job opportunities and career prospects.

- **International and European Professions:**  
  The International Studies program equips students with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to work in EU institutions or in national and regional public administrations and interest groups in Brussels as administrative officers.
  
- **Project Design and Management:**  
  Graduates can also find employment in community project design and management, particularly within non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the third sector, working in areas like development cooperation.

- **Public Administration and Research:**  
  Graduates may work in public administration and research, particularly in roles related to EU relations, foreign affairs, or operational research.

- **Freelance Professions:**  
  The degree can serve as a foundation for careers in journalism or public relations, especially as foreign correspondents.

- **Academic Research and High-Specialization Professions:**  
  The program provides foundational knowledge for pursuing careers as political scientists, historians, or advisers in foreign and international policy.
