## Course Overview

- **Degree Level:** Bachelor's Degree

The Bachelor's degree in Philosophy is a three-year program designed to provide a solid philosophical foundation, preparing students for master's degrees in philosophy and other related fields. At the same time, it ensures that students acquire the essential conceptual tools and knowledge needed to access, in later stages of their education or professional life, areas outside strictly philosophical domains.

The program is specifically designed to develop graduates who possess:
- Theoretical knowledge (content, methods, tools) in the various disciplines within philosophy
- The ability to apply such knowledge to specific philosophical issues and broader, real-world questions with philosophical implications.

After completing the Philosophy degree, students will have not only a wide range of knowledge in different philosophical areas but also a critical mindset, an open mentality, and the capacity to engage with the world dynamically, flexibly, and creatively.

### Career Paths

#### Logical and Philosophy of Science Path
This career path explores the border between mathematical knowledge and philosophical and general humanistic knowledge. The study plan includes significant focus on logical-linguistic philosophical disciplines.

#### Ethics, Politics, and Religious Studies Path
This career focuses on major theoretical, ethical-political, and theological issues. It adopts a critical-hermeneutic approach rather than a traditional historical one. Courses in Jewish and Islamic thought (in addition to Christian history) provide a broad, comparative view of religious studies.

#### History of Philosophy, Historical Sciences, and Human Sciences Path
This career aims to deepen the understanding of philosophical thought's historical evolution, from ancient times to the 20th and 21st centuries. All major periods of Western philosophy (ancient, medieval, Renaissance, modern, late modern, and contemporary) are analyzed in their specific features, through reading classical philosophical works.

#### Customized Study Plan
Students may opt for a personalized study plan, which must be evaluated and approved by the Academic Coordinator in accordance with the course's academic regulations.

### Educational Approach
The curriculum includes lectures, seminars, exercises, and tutorials designed to provide basic knowledge in the defined areas and related methodological competencies. A specific course is offered to consolidate knowledge of a European language other than Italian, verified upon entry.

The program is enriched with additional activities such as internships, seminars, study days, and international conferences, all open to student participation. The Philosophy degree also provides ample opportunities for study abroad experiences.

### Educational Goals
The Bachelor's degree aims to provide comprehensive philosophical training, covering traditional research areas such as:
- Theoretical, ethical, religious, political, aesthetic, logical, and epistemological issues.
- A rigorous study of the history of thought from ancient times to the present day.

The goal is not only to familiarize students with the sources of Western philosophical tradition but also to equip them with the philological, historical, and conceptual tools necessary to appreciate its high humanistic value. A portion of the teaching focuses on methodological aspects and examines typical philosophical argumentative structures from both historical and logical perspectives. Despite emphasizing the specificity of philosophical concepts and methods, the program encourages interdisciplinary approaches.

In addition to traditional philosophical subjects, the curriculum includes related courses from other areas, including pedagogy, psychology, sociology, religious studies, scientific-mathematical studies, linguistics, literature, and history.

### Professional Profiles
The ability to choose between recommended or free study plans, deepen knowledge of at least one foreign language, and engage in internships and other specific training activities allows students to access various professional sectors. The Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy prepares students for a dynamic understanding and interpretation of the ever-evolving cultural and social realities.

#### Possible Careers
Graduates can pursue professional roles such as:
- Archive and library assistants
- Information acquisition technicians
- Public relations technicians
- Library technicians
- Social reintegration and integration technicians
- Employment services technicians

#### Career Opportunities
Graduates can find opportunities in:
- Public and private social organizations (non-profits)
- Publishing and journalism
- Libraries
- Tourism and territorial promotion companies
- Interreligious and intercultural dialogue centers
- Private companies specializing in human resources management

### Post-Graduation Studies

- Master's degrees in the field of Philosophical Sciences (LM-78), including the Master's in Philosophy and Languages of Modernity at the University of Trento
