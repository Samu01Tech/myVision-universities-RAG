### Characteristics and Objectives

The Bachelor's Degree in Orthopedic Techniques belongs to the class of Health Professions Technical Sciences. It lasts three years. Graduates in Orthopedic Techniques are healthcare professionals who, based on medical prescriptions and subsequent testing, perform the construction, adaptation, application, and supply of prostheses, orthoses, and auxiliary devices for substitution, correction, and support of the musculoskeletal system. These devices may be functional or aesthetic, mechanical, or powered by external or combined body and external energy. Graduates take direct measurements and molds of the patient and train individuals with disabilities in the use of the applied prostheses and orthoses. They assist with technical support for the provision, replacement, and repair of prostheses and orthoses in collaboration with medical professionals. Additionally, they collaborate in multidisciplinary treatments as part of a rehabilitation plan and are responsible for organizing, planning, and ensuring the quality of the professional actions within their duties.

### Educational Objectives

The program aims to provide a solid foundation in basic disciplines to understand the most relevant elements underlying pathological processes in pediatric, adult, and geriatric populations. These are the focus of the orthopedic technician's work, which supports the specialist physician’s diagnosis.  

Professional skills are developed through theoretical and practical training, including behavioral competencies, ensuring students master all necessary skills and can apply them immediately in the workplace upon graduation. Practical training and clinical internships, supervised by assigned professional tutors, play a central role in the program.  

### Yearly Breakdown:
1. **First Year**: Orientation and foundational knowledge in orthopedic techniques and related sciences.
2. **Second Year**: Clinical focus on diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative approaches to the musculoskeletal system. Introduction to medical devices like prostheses and orthoses.
3. **Third Year**: Preparation for professional practice with specialized coursework, practical training, and the gradual assumption of autonomy and responsibility.

### First Year

Focused on orienting students within their new academic environment, developing critical thinking, appropriate terminology, and a systematic study approach. Students acquire foundational knowledge in orthotic-prosthetic sciences, basic sciences, and biomechanics. The first internship introduces students to professional environments and basic competencies.

### Second Year

Concentrates on clinical issues of the musculoskeletal system, including medical and surgical diagnostic paths, therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions, biomechanics, and medical devices. This year emphasizes:
- Diagnostic and therapeutic processes
- Functional reasoning to identify appropriate devices
- Clinical, technical, and practical analysis for therapeutic goals

### Third Year

Emphasizes specialized technical and biomechanical disciplines, addressing professional practice, organization, and legal frameworks. Students engage in internships to gradually gain autonomy and responsibility, directly executing orthopedic devices under supervision.
