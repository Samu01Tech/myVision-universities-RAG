### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the Bachelor’s Degree in Biomedical Laboratory Techniques, students will have acquired the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to meet the demands of diagnostic laboratory services. Specifically, students must demonstrate the ability to:

- Understand biological sampling techniques, manage biological material sampling and verification, ensure compliance of requests, and prepare samples for subsequent stages.
- Perform biological sampling in preclinical settings (e.g., peripheral venous blood sampling or capillary blood sampling from adults in low-complexity scenarios) and conduct non-invasive microbiological tests (e.g., naso-oropharyngeal swabs, urine/stool cultures, or skin swabs).
- Plan and execute analytical phases using appropriate methods and technologies, adhering to laboratory quality standards, including decentralized diagnostics (Point of Care Testing).
- Critically evaluate and document the reliability of test results according to laboratory quality systems and patient health conditions.
- Manage diagnostic processes in compliance with quality systems and actively contribute to the development of validation systems for laboratory tests and analyses, including decentralized diagnostics.
- Ensure workplace safety and participate in risk assessments and the implementation of prevention and protection measures.
- Independently conduct research using databases and search engines to critically evaluate and acquire new knowledge related to laboratory technologies, using this information to develop new methods and implement tests and analyses.
- Contribute constructively to the development of the profession, structures, and healthcare organizations.
- Act responsibly and professionally, addressing ethical and deontological issues concerning users and interdisciplinary collaboration with other healthcare professionals.
- Manage personal and professional growth in line with technological, scientific, and societal advancements while being aware of career development potential.

### Study Plan
The curriculum includes 20 exams, organized primarily as integrated tests within coordinated courses or modules to ensure a unified, interdisciplinary approach to the educational objectives.

**Teaching methods** include lectures, seminars, group work, case discussions, and simulations aimed at achieving the program's educational objectives. Modern teaching tools support the learning process.

In addition to traditional teaching, the program integrates guided internships carried out in healthcare and academic settings, including university clinics, hospital units, pharmaceutical companies, and other accredited private or scientific institutions in Italy or abroad through specific agreements.

The practical training allows students to gradually assume professional responsibility and autonomy, enabling them to address diagnostic-laboratory challenges, plan assistance in the field, and integrate into healthcare teams.

Practical training and clinical internships are supervised and guided by professional tutors and coordinated by faculty from the specific professional field.

**Assessment:** Learning outcomes are detailed in the syllabus for each course. Professionalizing activities amount to at least 60 ECTS, including internships, laboratory work, and practical activities conducted in appropriate facilities.  
To graduate, students must earn **180 ECTS**.
