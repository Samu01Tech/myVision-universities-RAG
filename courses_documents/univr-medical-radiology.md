### Course Description

The degree program provides knowledge on the principles of operation of equipment used in Diagnostic Imaging, Nuclear Medicine, and Radiotherapy. It offers a foundational understanding of pathological processes affecting pediatric, adult, and geriatric populations, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in Radiodiagnostics, Nuclear Medicine, and Radiotherapy. Special emphasis is placed on Radiation Protection and the primary procedures related to Health Physics.

Graduates will be able to independently or collaboratively, under medical prescription, carry out diagnostic procedures requiring the use of ionizing radiation sources (both artificial and natural), thermal and ultrasonic energy, or magnetic resonance. They will also perform tasks related to physical or dosimetric protection.

The Bachelor's Degree in Medical Radiology Techniques, Imaging, and Radiotherapy is a limited-access program. It requires an adequate initial preparation in physics and mathematics. Alongside traditional lectures, the program includes simulations on phantoms, small group laboratories, and over 1500 hours of internship in affiliated facilities. Students can also undertake internships abroad (Erasmus) through international exchange agreements with partner universities.

This program prepares Medical Radiology Technicians (TSRM) who work in public or private healthcare facilities and research institutions, either as employees or freelance professionals. They utilize innovative technologies and equipment in medical imaging and radiotherapy. Additionally, graduates can find opportunities in production industries and sales agencies operating in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy sectors.

### In-progress Tutoring

During internships, students are supervised through a multi-level tutoring system, typically conducted by professionals in the same field as the students. The levels of tutoring include:

- **Professional Tutor**: A highly skilled tutor with both pedagogical and professional expertise. They assist in organizing and managing internships, designing and conducting professional training workshops, and addressing learning difficulties. They monitor evaluation processes and serve as a liaison with internship sites.  
- **Supervisor**: An operator from the internship site who helps colleagues select learning opportunities aligned with student goals. They provide support during the student's training and evaluation phases and are trained for their tutorial role.  
- **Internship Guide**: A professional who guides students during internships while performing regular work activities. They ensure the safety of students and service users, maintain service quality, and ensure that users are informed and consent to being assisted by students.

Tutors are usually professionals from the same field and are selected in collaboration with affiliated healthcare facilities. Assignments are typically granted on a three-year basis.

Internship experiences are planned, assessed, and documented as part of the student's academic journey. Each internship includes formative evaluations through interviews and evaluation forms. At the end of each academic year, a summative evaluation is conducted to certify the student's professional competency development.
