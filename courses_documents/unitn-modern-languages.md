# University of Trento, Modern Languages

## Course Overview

** Degree Level: Bachelor's Degree
**Course Class**: L-11 - Modern Languages and Cultures  
**Language of Instruction**: Italian  
**Access Mode**: Restricted, with the completion of an entrance test  
**Location**: Department of Humanities, via Tommaso Gar 14, 38122 Trento.

The Bachelor's degree in Modern Languages is structured into two pathways:

1. **Literature, Languages, and Translation (LLT)** - This pathway focuses on languages, communication, and the translation of foreign cultures and literatures.
2. **Languages for Tourism and Business Intermediation (LITI)** - This pathway is more focused on languages applied to the fields of economics and tourism management.

The program aims to provide graduates with a solid foundation in theoretical linguistics and in two languages and their respective cultures, chosen from English, French, Spanish, Russian (only for the LITI pathway), and German.

Language, culture, and literature lessons are offered in the original language from the first year, creating an environment conducive to achieving high levels of proficiency both orally and in writing.

### Learning Objectives

The Bachelor's degree in Modern Languages equips students with the theoretical and methodological tools necessary to understand phenomena of legal-economic, historical-geographical, philological-literary, and linguistic-cultural nature related to the countries of the studied languages.

Graduates will also acquire the theoretical tools for text analysis through knowledge of linguistic-communicative functions, the principles of theoretical linguistics, contrastive analysis, and translation into and from their first/Italian language.

The degree program in Modern Languages includes a common curriculum for both pathways focused on the acquisition and consolidation of language and metalinguistic skills in Italian (written and oral), the languages and cultures of study, and the primary information technology and methodological tools. Central areas include communication, text analysis and production (both written and oral), and the theory and practice of translation.

In addition to these shared skills, students will develop specific competencies depending on their chosen pathway:

- **In the "Literature, Languages, and Translation" (LLT) curriculum**, with a linguistic-literary focus, courses will delve into methodological tools related to historical-cultural and philological-literary fields, including an introduction to literary and institutional translation.
  
- **In the "Languages for Tourism and Business Intermediation" (LITI) curriculum**, there will be an emphasis on applying linguistic skills, economic-business knowledge, and geographical knowledge of territorial systems to intercultural and professional communication, both nationally and internationally, with particular attention to new technologies.
