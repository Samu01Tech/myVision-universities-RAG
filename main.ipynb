In contemporary history, they will study significant events of the 20th century and their key interpretations. In political science, students will learn the language and conceptualizations specific to the discipline, focusing on the democratic process and democratization. In political economy, attention will be given to the main macroeconomic theories. Public law will introduce elements of European public law, as a combination of state and supranational law. In statistics, the basics of data analysis will be taught. Special emphasis is placed on English language skills.\n","\n","- **Second Year:**  \n","  The second year presents essential tools for empirical research in social sciences and knowledge of international law. It also covers comparative political systems, their behavior, and international relations. From a historical perspective, students will learn about the development of the modern state from medieval origins to the consolidation of the modern era, concluding with a brief discussion on the crisis of the contemporary state. As in the first year, a specialized English course will complement linguistic training. Some courses will be specific to two educational tracks. In the \"Politics and International Organizations\" track, students will study international organizations, while in the \"Cooperation and Development\" track, the focus will be on topics from international development sociology.\n","\n","- **Third Year:**  \n","  The third year offers more specific courses, dedicated to key research topics in European and international studies, social inequalities, social movements, European civil society, citizenship and European democracy, conflict management, and more. An international political economy course will complete the multidisciplinary training. By the end of the third year, students must demonstrate knowledge of a second foreign language. Additionally, seminars on contemporary economic, political, and social system transformations will be offered. To enhance coherence in the curriculum, students are encouraged to choose two elective exams from a selection of key subjects.\n","### Programme Overview  \n","The Bachelor’s degree in **Applied Mathematics** offers a unique educational programme in northeastern Italy.
