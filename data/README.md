## Data Collection and Usage

We've gathered publicly available information directly from the official websites of both universities. We couldn't find any explicit copyright notices on these sites that would restrict the use of this data. However, if you are an authorized representative of either university and wish for any specific data to be removed, please don't hesitate to contact me at samuele.mazzei_at_studenti.unitn.it.
