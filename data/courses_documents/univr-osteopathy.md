### Programme Overview 
The Bachelor’s Degree in **Osteopathy** (Class L-SNT/04) trains healthcare professionals to:  
- Identify and treat somatic dysfunctions unrelated to pathologies through evaluation and manual treatment techniques.  
- Prevent musculoskeletal symptoms or disorders across all age groups.  
- Work autonomously or in multidisciplinary teams to support interventions guided by best practices or official guidelines.  
- Educate individuals, caregivers, and communities about preventive practices and health maintenance.  
- Evaluate the outcomes of their interventions against agreed objectives.  
- Collaborate with other healthcare professionals when somatic dysfunctions are secondary to pathologies.  
- Conduct research using databases to find guidelines or best practices.  
- Offer consultancy or training in public or private healthcare facilities.  

The study programme covers the determinants of health from a bio-psycho-social perspective, focusing on:  
- Preventing musculoskeletal, nervous system, and circulatory system disorders.  
- Promoting good posture and physical activity.  
- Maintaining health in both healthy individuals and those with chronic movement or visceral disorders.  

Graduates can work as employees in private facilities or as independent professionals. Employment in public healthcare is contingent on the inclusion of osteopathic services in Italy’s Essential Levels of Care (LEA), as per DPR n. 131 of July 7, 2021.  

Graduates may pursue further education through first-level master’s programmes or postgraduate degrees in healthcare disciplines.
