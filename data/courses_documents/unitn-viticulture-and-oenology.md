### Educational Objectives
  
The graduate in Viticulture and Enology will acquire comprehensive knowledge in core subjects, particularly in agronomics, genetics, plant pathology, and enological technologies.  

Graduates will also gain the ability to recognize and manage biotic factors (animals, plants, microorganisms) and abiotic factors (atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere) within the agro-ecosystem, as well as the processes involved in raw material transformation. They will be able to plan and oversee all aspects of vineyard production and winemaking processes.  

Graduates will understand business environments and the economic aspects of the viticulture and agro-food sectors.  

The knowledge and skills acquired, including practical laboratory experience, will focus on agricultural and microbiological aspects, with a particular emphasis on quality control of viticulture and enology products, analysis of biological matrices, and agricultural soils.  

Graduates will also develop competencies in:  

- The **scientific investigation method**, enabling them to contribute to experimental research to solve applied problems in the viticulture sector.  
- **Decision-making criteria** aimed at reducing the environmental impact of viticultural and enological activities.  
- **Adopting and transferring innovations** to the production sector efficiently.  
- **Regulatory and managerial aspects** of the sector, with the ability to frame them in both national and international contexts.  
- **Continuous learning and professional development**, using foundational cognitive tools for further education and training.

### Career Opportunities
Graduates will find opportunities within the viticulture and enology sector, holding management roles throughout the entire production chain—from vineyard planting and agronomic/plant health management to grape production, winemaking, quality control, and marketing.  

Potential professional roles include working as an employee, collaborator, or consultant, either individually or as part of an association, in the following areas:  

- Wine production companies and enterprises within the viticultural supply chain.  
- Public or private territorial entities.  
- Viticulture sector associations.  
- Wholesale and retail trade of wine and its derivatives.  
- Food distribution sector.  
- Technical-scientific publishing and information on wine.  
- Hospitality and restaurant sectors.  
- Research and development centers in viticulture and enology.

### Postgraduate Studies 
The Viticulture and Enology degree is a professional qualification that allows graduates to enter the workforce directly.  

Graduates can also pursue:  

- Master's degrees that require a bachelor's degree in CL-25, possibly with additional credit requirements if the chosen field differs from viticulture.  
- First-level master's programs or executive master's programs.  
- Further specializations through internships and placements in research institutions or universities.  

Graduates can also advance their careers in the research and development sector of companies specializing in winemaking aids and products, viticulture machinery and technology, and the wine industry itself.
