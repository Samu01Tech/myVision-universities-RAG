# University of Trento, Business Management

## Course Overview

The Bachelor's Degree in Business Management is designed for ambitious students who, from the very start of their studies, aim to acquire managerial skills and techniques to address the challenges of businesses of all sizes.

With an approach that emphasizes active student learning, the program combines disciplinary knowledge with a continuous focus on real-world businesses in various sectors (private, for-profit, public administration, and non-profit organizations). Core managerial skills (marketing, finance, organization, quality management, control, etc.) are developed through specialized courses and workshops, using a problem-based learning methodology. The program encourages international experiences, including internships, as part of the university networks in which the Department participates.

Key topics include:  
- The interaction between businesses and markets  
- Employee and consumer behavior  
- Actions for radical organizational and strategic change  
- The family nature of businesses  
- Managerial decision-making  

The program also provides a foundation for understanding the economic and macroeconomic dynamics that affect businesses, as well as basic legal knowledge.

### Methodological Approach

The program aims to develop both managerial skills and the holistic education of students as individuals, fostering critical analysis and independent judgment.

To achieve this, the program emphasizes:  
- Active student participation  
- Interaction and idea exchange in addition to individual study  

The curriculum integrates a solid conceptual and methodological foundation with practical applications, using continuous references to real business contexts as a defining feature.

This goal is achieved through:  
- Specialized courses focused on managerial skills development  
- Applied workshops using a problem-based learning approach  
- A variety of teaching methods, such as group work, case study analysis and discussion, in-class group presentations, and qualitative-quantitative analyses  

The educational experience is completed with an **internship in a company**, which extends and solidifies the knowledge acquired during university studies.  

Temporary study periods at other universities or abroad (exchange programs) and additional internships beyond the mandatory one are highly encouraged.

### Prerequisites

The program is open to students from various academic backgrounds and does not require specific prior knowledge or prerequisites.

The main topics will be taught from the ground up, making it possible for students with no prior exposure to business management to learn the discipline.

### Career and Further Studies

The three-year program in Business Management prepares students to pursue Master's Degrees within the Department of Economics and Management at the University of Trento, as well as at other Italian or international universities.  

Graduates can choose to continue with advanced studies immediately after completing the three-year program or gain practical experience through a corporate internship before entering a Master's program.
