### Yearly Breakdown:

The curriculum is structured to address three key aspects of the Medical Radiology Technologist’s role:
- **Motivation and aptitude**
- **Professional capabilities**
- **Scientific culture**

#### 1st Year
Focused on providing a strong foundation in essential theoretical disciplines derived from basic sciences, aimed at their subsequent professional application. Students will also learn the fundamentals of disciplines characterizing the profession, including concepts of radiation protection and safety, which are prerequisites for the first internship experience. The focus will be on professional orientation, enhancing awareness of the professional role and work environments (Radiodiagnostics, Radiotherapy, Protontherapy, Nuclear Medicine, Medical Physics, Interventional Hemodynamics).

Multiple internship experiences are scheduled in contexts where students can apply their acquired knowledge, methodologies, and techniques under the supervision of expert tutors trained in pedagogical methods and tutorial techniques.

#### 2nd Year
The second year emphasizes specialized areas, procedures, and techniques in Imaging Diagnostics, such as Senology, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Radiotherapy, with in-depth knowledge of Adrotherapy and Protontherapy. Theoretical courses will focus on developing relational and communication skills specific to the technologist’s clinical applications.

Internship opportunities in specialized contexts continue, enabling students to refine their skills under expert supervision.

#### 3rd Year
Specialized focus on Interventional Radiology, Cardiology Hemodynamics, Echocardiography, Neuroradiology, Angiography, and Nuclear Medicine. The second semester emphasizes knowledge and methodologies for professional practice, healthcare legislation, and organizational principles, along with the ethical and deontological foundations of the profession.

Internship experiences gain increasing relevance, offering students opportunities for progressive autonomy and responsibility under expert supervision. The distribution of credits reflects the growing importance of internship experiences from the 1st to the 3rd year.
