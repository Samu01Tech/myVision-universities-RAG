# University of Verona, Biomedical Laboratory

## Course Overview

### Learning Outcomes
At the end of the Biomedical Laboratory Techniques program, students must have acquired the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to meet the expectations of diagnostic laboratory services. Specifically, students should demonstrate the ability to:

- **Manage biological sampling**: handle and verify biological material, ensure compliance with requests, and prepare samples for subsequent stages.
- **Plan and execute analytical processes**: implement appropriate methods and technologies following laboratory quality recommendations and standards.
- **Critically evaluate and document results**: assess and document the reliability of test results in alignment with laboratory quality systems, while considering patients' health and treatment plans.
- **Manage the diagnostic process**: operate within quality systems and actively contribute to developing control systems for the validity of laboratory tests and analyses.
- **Ensure workplace safety**: manage workplace safety, evaluate risks, and implement preventive measures.
- **Conduct independent research**: explore databases and search engines to critically acquire new knowledge on laboratory technologies and use this information to develop methods and implement tests.
- **Contribute to professional development**: participate in the advancement of the profession, structures, and healthcare organizations.
- **Maintain professional responsibility**: address ethical and deontological issues related to users and collaborate interdisciplinarily with other healthcare professionals.
- **Pursue lifelong learning**: manage personal and professional growth in line with technological, scientific, and social progress, recognizing career development opportunities.

The study plan includes exams structured as integrated tests, often in coordinated teaching modules, to ensure both a unified and multidisciplinary understanding of educational objectives. 

#### Teaching Methods
- **Lectures**, **seminars**, **work groups**, and **discussions** on relevant topics and simulations to achieve learning objectives.
- **Modern teaching tools** to support learning.
- **Supervised internships** carried out in healthcare and university settings, such as university clinics, hospital units, pharmaceutical companies, and accredited private institutions, both nationally and internationally.

This structure enables students to take on progressive responsibility and professional autonomy. Internships focus on diagnostic-laboratory challenges, planning assistance, and integrating into work teams alongside other healthcare professionals. 

Internships and clinical practice are supervised by trained professional tutors and coordinated by faculty members from the relevant professional profile. Practical training accounts for at least 60 ECTS credits and is conducted in appropriate facilities. The curriculum is continuously monitored and optimized to ensure compliance with legal standards and program-specific objectives.

### Yearly Breakdown:

#### **1st Year**
Focus: Fundamental biomedical and preventive health knowledge, and basic professional skills for initial internships in anatomy, clinical biochemistry, and microbiology laboratories.

#### **2nd Year**
Focus: Advanced knowledge in general pathology, clinical pathology, pharmacology, and toxicology. Professional skills are developed in anatomical pathology, immunohematology, clinical microbiology, food microbiology, and toxicology. Students engage in multiple internships to apply acquired knowledge and techniques.

#### **3rd Year**
Focus: Specialization in molecular biology, professional methodologies, teamwork, and complex organizational contexts. Scientific research methodologies support the final thesis. Internships emphasize increased autonomy and responsibility, supervised by experts. Internship credits increase progressively from the 1st to the 3rd year.
