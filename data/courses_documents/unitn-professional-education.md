### Career Opportunities

Professional Educators work in both socio-educational and health settings, such as:

- Health organizations
- Local communities
- Municipalities
- Social Services
- Social cooperatives
- Social promotion associations

The presence of Professional Educators is a mandatory requirement for the accreditation of socio-health-educational services, contributing to high demand in the labor market.

100% of graduates from the Professional Education program at UniTrento, offered in collaboration with the University of Ferrara (2006-2020), are employed one year after graduation (source: Almalaurea).

### Post-Graduation Studies

The program provides basic theoretical training in the following areas:

The theoretical training is effectively integrated with a 60-credit professional internship at external health and socio-educational structures. Tutors (Professional Educators registered in the registry) plan and manage internship activities and monitor their implementation.

The evaluation of acquired skills considers both theoretical knowledge and practical skills gained by students through integrated courses across multiple disciplines.
