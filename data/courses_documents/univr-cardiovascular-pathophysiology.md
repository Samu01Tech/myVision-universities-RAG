Documents all extracorporeal circulation activities in the patientâ€™s medical record, including a pre-CEC checklist.
- Prepares, operates, and weans patients from all cardio-respiratory assistance systems and circulatory support systems for both short- and long-term use.
- Conducts echocardiographic and/or ultrasound exams, including quantitative and Doppler flow evaluations of cardiac and/or vascular systems.
- Manages computerized systems for storing and transmitting cardiological exams. Operates electrocardiography, stress electrocardiography, dynamic electrocardiography (Holter), and brady-tachyarrhythmia event recording systems.
- Performs instrumental checks for patients with pacemakers or implantable automatic defibrillators and conducts diagnostic procedures in outpatient settings or using telemedicine and telemetry systems.
- Executes technical activities related to renal replacement therapies (e.g., extracorporeal hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, CVVH, etc.).
- Performs respiratory functionality tests using spirometry.
- Operates and maintains equipment for hemodynamic and non-invasive cardiology techniques.
- Manages perioperative PBM (Patient Blood Management) methods such as intraoperative plasmapheresis, preparation of platelet gel and fibrin glue, and blood recovery techniques.
- Conducts organ preservation and manages organ transportation using machine perfusion and applying ex-vivo perfusion protocols.
- Applies normothermic and hyperthermic extracorporeal techniques for anti-cancer therapies targeting the pelvis, peritoneum, thorax, limbs, and liver.
- Provides technical assistance for cardiac assessments in sports medicine using cardiological diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and telemetry.
- Offers technical consultancy for the development and design of biomedical devices specific to their discipline. Serves as a product specialist to train and guide healthcare professionals in using biomedical devices for procedures.
- Engages in organizational healthcare activities to improve the quality of healthcare processes (PDTA) in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.
- Participates in developing operational instructions to improve service efficiency and effectiveness for better patient outcomes. 
- May take on professional growth roles such as Coordinator, Functional Area Manager, or Head of Simple or Complex Operational Units after completing advanced university programs as regulated by current legislation.
- Contributes to professional education by transferring expertise to new hires. After completing specific training programs, they can also serve as university tutors or directors of professional didactics in undergraduate or Master's programs in their area of expertise.
- Participates in scientific research within their field of work and may pursue Ph.D. studies or an academic career.

### Yearly Breakdown:

- **1st Year**: Focuses on basic biomedical and hygiene-prevention knowledge, and foundational professional discipline. Prepares students for their first internship experience to orient them to professional fields and develop basic competencies.
- **2nd Year**: Explores interventional cardiology, vascular diagnostics, pneumology, thoracic surgery, pediatric and adult cardiac surgery, and nephrology. Develops skills in conducting echocardiographic exams, cardiorespiratory functionality tests, and extracorporeal circulation for adults and children.
