Most of the collections are displayed in the library along 2.5 kilometers of shelves, which are directly accessible to the public.  
In Sector D, 16 workstations with PCs are available for the consultation of digital resources. In the reading rooms (Sectors A, B, D, and F), there are an additional 336 seats dedicated to consultation and study.  
In Sector A, on open-access shelves, the last six years of economic and legal periodicals with an active subscription are available.  
Periodicals, exam program texts, and reference works can only be consulted in the reading rooms. All other volumes can be borrowed either through the self-loan station or by contacting the staff at the Loan Service desk, located in Sector E.  
The underground storage area, accessible only to staff, contains 3.5 kilometers of compact shelving where discontinued periodicals, active periodicals older than six years, and low-demand books are kept. These materials can be accessed upon request to the library staff.
